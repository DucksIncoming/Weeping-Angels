# Weeping Angels (Name WIP)

This project is designed to be used with a statue with a rotatable head. When you're looking at the statue, you won't see anything out of the ordinary with it. Once you turn away and look back, however, it will mysteriously be looking directly at you (gasp (so scary) (incredible (aaaah)) (i am so scared))
